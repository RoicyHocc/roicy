# roicy is learning to code & program in Python from scratch
Also learning a bit more English every day.
Trying to learn something that sounds counterintuitive is pretty hard for me.
But I'm really glad I'm doing it, mostly on my own, but constantly inspired by lots of people at the same time.
It gets more interesting every day.
So far so good.
Stay tuned.
