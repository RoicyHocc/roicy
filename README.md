Day1

# roicy is learning to code & program in Python from scratch
Also learning a bit more English every day.
Trying to learn something that sounds counterintuitive is pretty hard for me.
But I'm really glad I'm doing it, mostly on my own, but constantly inspired by lots of people at the same time.
It gets more interesting every day.
So far so good.
Current progress: 11%



Day 12

A lot of progress in the last 2 weeks, mainly because I'm taking this more seriously than before.
Also getting into more boring parts, so keeping up and not giving up is very important at the moment.

Current progress: 22%.



Day 14

After a while of learning how to chop, slice and mix all the ingredients, now starting to cook a proper meal with Python. I like omelette egg, two slices of toast and Earl Grey tea, here we go.

Current progress:30%
